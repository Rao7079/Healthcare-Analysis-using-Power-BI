# Healthcare-Analysis-using-Power-BI

Iâ€™m excited to share a recent project I worked on â€” Healthcare Analysis using Power BI â€” where I analyzed patient data to uncover key health trends and insights. This project allowed me to apply my data visualization and analytical skills to real-world healthcare data.
ðŸ›  Tools Used:

Power BI for data visualization

DAX for calculated columns and measures

Excel/CSV dataset for data input

ðŸ“ˆ This project helped me better understand how data can drive decisions in the healthcare industry by identifying at-risk populations and health behavior patterns.
